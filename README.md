Open Journal System
========================

Welcome to the Symfony Standard Edition - a fully-functional Symfony2
application that you can use as the skeleton for your new applications.

This document contains information on how to download, install, and start
using Symfony. For a more detailed explanation, see the [Installation][1]
chapter of the Symfony Documentation.

1) Installing the Standard Edition
----------------------------------

When it comes to installing the Symfony Standard Edition, you have the
following options.

### Use Composer (*recommended*)

As Symfony uses [Composer][2] to manage its dependencies, the recommended way
to create a new project is to use it.

If you don't have Composer yet, download it following the instructions on
http://getcomposer.org/ or just run the following command:

    curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php

Then, use the `update` command to generate a new Symfony application:

    php composer.phar update





2) Checking your System Configuration
-------------------------------------

Before starting coding, make sure that your local system is properly
configured for Symfony.

Execute the `check.php` script from the command line:

    php app/check.php

The script returns a status code of `0` if all mandatory requirements are met,
`1` otherwise.

Access the `config.php` script from a browser:

    http://localhost/path/to/symfony/app/web/config.php

If you get any warnings or recommendations, fix them before moving on.



3) Getting started with Symfony
-------------------------------

This distribution is meant to be the starting point for your Symfony
applications, but it also contains some sample code that you can learn from
and play with.

A great way to start learning Symfony is via the [Quick Tour][4], which will
take you through all the basic features of Symfony2.

Once you're feeling good, you can move onto reading the official
[Symfony2 book][5].

A default bundle, `AcmeDemoBundle`, shows you Symfony2 in action. After
playing with it, you can remove it by following these steps:

  * delete the `src/Acme` directory;

  * remove the routing entry referencing AcmeDemoBundle in `app/config/routing_dev.yml`;

  * remove the AcmeDemoBundle from the registered bundles in `app/AppKernel.php`;

  * remove the `web/bundles/acmedemo` directory;

  * remove the `security.providers`, `security.firewalls.login` and
    `security.firewalls.secured_area` entries in the `security.yml` file or
    tweak the security configuration to fit your needs.

What's inside?
